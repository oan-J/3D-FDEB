# upgrade FDEB to 3D


This is a simple upgrade of force-directed edge bundling from 2D to 3D.



## Instuction


1. **Input Example:**
   - Replace the provided example, `3d_node_edge.xml`, with your own data file.

2. **3D Edge Bundle Upgrade:**
   - Utilize `3d-force_edge_bundle.js` as a straightforward enhancement from 2D Force Edge Bundle to 3D.

3. **Live 3D Visualization:**
   - Execute `go live 3d-index.html` to generate a JSON output. This output can be employed for immersive 3D visualization.



## Recommendation
Consider leveraging Three.js for visualizing your results and exploring the bundled edges. An example of the visualization outcome is here.
